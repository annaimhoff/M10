“There were some things I didn't like about this film. Here's what I remember most strongly: a man in an ingeniously fake-looking polar bear costume (funnier than the "bear" from Hercules in New York); an extra with a less than believable laugh; an ex-drug addict martian with tics; child actors who recite their lines very slowly and carefully; a newspaper headline declaring that Santa has been "kidnapped", and a giant robot. The least appealing acting job in the film must be when Mother Claus and her elves have been "frozen" by the "Martians'" weapons. They seemed to display an exaggerated amount of fear. Perhaps this was the preferred acting style in the 1960's??”
