“There were some things I didn't like about this film. Here's what I remember most 
strongly: a man in an ingeniously fake-looking polar bear costume (funnier than the 
"bear" from Hercules in New York); an extra with a less than believable laugh; an ex-drug 
addict martian with tics; child actors who recite their lines very slowly and carefully; 
a newspaper headline declaring that Santa has been "kidnapped", and a giant robot. The 
least appealing acting job in the film must be when Mother Claus and her elves have been 
"frozen" by the "Martians'" weapons. They seemed to display an exaggerated amount of 
fear. Perhaps this was the preferred acting style in the 1960's??”
